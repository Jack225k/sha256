# SHA 256 Hashing algorith build for C#.
The objective of this application is to secure user passwords and make sure that the hashed password is different every time.

This was programmed by me to quickly write my own security algorithm to store user information because personally I do not like the Microsoft User Identity Class. Editing information within the Identity class is a shithole. So rather program your own shit.

Any jobs? Email me @ jack@mergemedia.co.za

Thanks.
